# LeadGenius Pro Agent API

This skill provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the LeadGenius Pro Agent API.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Lead Management
- **Bulk List (EnrichLeads)**: Use `GET /enrich-leads/list` for high-volume data extraction from the enriched leads table (requires Amplify API key).
- **Bulk List (SourceLeads)**: Use `GET /source-leads/list` for raw source data extraction (requires Amplify API key).
- **Update Status**: Use `PUT /leads/{id}/status` to track progress (New -> Qualified -> Contacted).
- **Batch Operations**: Create or delete multiple leads simultaneously with `POST /leads/batch` or `DELETE /leads/batch`.

### 2. Campaign Operations
- **Overview**: List all active ABM campaigns with `GET /campaigns`.
- **Performance**: Monitor ROI with `GET /campaigns/{id}/metrics`.
- **Creation**: Launch new initiatives with `POST /campaigns`.

### 3. Targeted ABM
- **Account Lists**: Manage high-value targets with `GET /target-accounts`.
- **Scoring**: Update account intent and fit scores with `PUT /target-accounts/{id}/score`.

### 4. Outreach & Engagement
- **Sequences**: List communication sequences with `GET /sequences`.
- **Enrollment**: Enroll leads into a specific sequence with `POST /sequences/{id}/enroll`.

### 5. Automation & Workflows
- **Custom Workflows**: Manage automated processes and agent handoffs with `GET /workflows`.
- **Status Jobs**: Monitor long-running processes (like enrichment or exports) with `GET /enrichment/status/{jobId}`.

### 6. Analytics & Insights
- **Pipeline Health**: Total visibility into conversion rates and pipeline velocity with `GET /analytics/pipeline`.

### 7. Maintenance & System Health
- **Bug Reporting**: Use `POST /maintenance/bugs` to report issues discovered by agents.
- **Enhancement Requests**: Use `POST /maintenance/enhancements` to suggest features.

### 8. Master Administration
- **Global Visibility**: List all companies and users across the platform (Admin only).
- **API Key Management**: Generate and rotate API keys for agent access.

## Technical Reference

### Base URLs
The API uses separate root paths depending on the operation scope. Standard agent interaction occurs via the **Agent Scope**, while high-volume extraction uses the **System Scope**.

1. **Agent API Operations**: `/api/agent` (e.g., `https://last.leadgenius.app/api/agent/leads`). Requires `X-API-Key` (lgp_...).
2. **Bulk Data Extraction (System Scope)**: `/api` (e.g., `https://last.leadgenius.app/api/enrich-leads/list`). Requires `x-api-key` (Amplify API key).
3. **Admin Scope**: `/api/admin` (e.g., `.../api/admin/companies`).

### Unified CLI (lgp.py)
The primary way to interact with LeadGenius is via the `lgp` CLI tool.

#### 1. Setup & Auth
```bash
python3 scripts/lgp.py auth --email your@email.com
```

#### 2. Manage Leads
```bash
# List leads
python3 scripts/lgp.py leads list

# Enrich specific leads
python3 scripts/lgp.py leads enrich --ids lead_1 lead_2
```

#### 3. Manage Campaigns
```bash
# List active campaigns
python3 scripts/lgp.py campaigns list

# Create a new campaign
python3 scripts/lgp.py campaigns create --name "Q3 Expansion"
```

#### 4. Insights & Analytics
```bash
# Show pipeline health for a specific period
python3 scripts/lgp.py pipeline --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-02-08
```

#### 5. Maintenance & Support
```bash
# List and report bugs
python3 scripts/lgp.py maintenance bugs list
python3 scripts/lgp.py maintenance bugs report --desc "Enrichment fails on LinkedIn URLs"

# List and request enhancements
python3 scripts/lgp.py maintenance enhancements list
python3 scripts/lgp.py maintenance enhancements request --desc "Add support for Google Maps leads"
```

#### 6. API Key Generation
```bash
# Generate a new API Key (Requires active session)
python3 scripts/lgp.py generate-key --name "Production Agent" --desc "Key for main auto-agent"
```

#### 7. Global Administration (Admin Only)
```bash
# View system-wide data
python3 scripts/lgp.py admin companies
python3 scripts/lgp.py admin users
```

### Reference Material
- **API Reference**: See [api_reference.md](references/api_reference.md) for detailed endpoint descriptions.
- **OpenAPI Spec**: See [openapi.json](references/openapi.json) for machine-readable schemas.

### Helper Scripts
- **[scripts/lgp.py](scripts/lgp.py)**: Unified CLI for all common operations.
- **[scripts/api_call.py](scripts/api_call.py)**: Low-level utility for custom raw API requests.
- **[scripts/auth.py](scripts/auth.py)**: Standalone auth utility.



## Common Payloads

### Create Campaign
```json
{
  "name": "Q1 ABM Tech Giants",
  "description": "Targeting top 50 tech firms for SaaS expansion",
  "campaignType": "abm",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Enrich Leads
```json
{
  "leadIds": ["lead_123", "lead_456"],
  "enrichmentType": "technographic",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

## Quick Start
To test your connection:
1. Set your API Key: `export LGP_API_KEY=lgp_your_key`
2. Fetch campaigns:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/api_call.py GET /campaigns
   ```


## Data Architecture & Logic
### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation
All data is strictly isolated by `company_id`. Even though agents use their own API keys, the system enforces that they only see leads associated with their assigned `company_id`.

### 2. Search Logic (LeadService)
The standard lead listing (`GET /leads`) uses a dual-query strategy to ensure no leads are missed:
- **By Company**: Queries the `company_id-GSI` to find all company-level leads.
- **By Owner**: Queries the `owner-GSI` to find leads specifically created by/assigned to the agent.
- **Merging**: Results are deduplicated and merged to provide a unified view.

### 3. Bulk Data Access
High-volume extraction (`GET /enrich-leads/list`) bypasses standard CRM logic in favor of raw GSI performance, requiring an explicit `companyId` parameter and matching Amplify API key.

### 4. Guardrails & Limits
- **Rate Limits**: 
  - **Minute**: 60 requests.
  - **Hour**: 1,000 requests.
  - **Day**: 10,000 requests.
- **Batching**: 
  - **Lead Creation**: Max 100 leads per request.
  - **Enrichment Trigger**: Max 500 leads per request.
- **Pagination**:
  - **Standard API**: Default 20, Max 100 per page.
  - **Bulk API**: Default 1,000, Max 5,000 per page.
- **Search Depth**: LeadService scans up to 1,000 records per GSI before in-memory merging.
